# mysql_cloudmanaged_databases

### Setup Process

The setup process was very straightforward but that might be because GCP was done in class so everything was very simple. 

### Experience

I used to use BigQuery for SQL exploration so using SQL Workbench was different. It was a big more confusing in my opinion but I also feel like after your explanation it was easier to work with. The ERD creation was confusing so I didn't really play with it all too much but I did make some changes but did not commit them because I don't think they made sense. 

### Errors

The only error I had was finding out how to create an ERD. That's because I didn't know you had to use the wizard first.
